# Django_AI_Codebot

#### This is a fun project built using Django and OpenAI api(ChatGPT).

Users may correct their current codes or get recommendations for any codes.

In order to allow users to log in to their private accounts and have their history of codes preserved for future references, storing codes and authentication functions have also been implemented using Django.



#### ChatGPT is a neural network model created by OpenAI that generates text. It is trained on a large corpus of text and can generate text in response to a prompt.

To run this project in your local system, you need python and OpenAI api key.
